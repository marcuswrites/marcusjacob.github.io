Accessibility, usability, design …</p> <p>For those of us who are particularly concerned about ensuring that web applications fit the needs of an audience with different faculties, there are a set of standards that are laid out that presumably will tell us how to do this. The question often comes up – is it worth the effort following standards like the W3C WCAG standard? There is a profusion of articles on the web that detail how standards compliance can be achieved and there are organizations who will help you, the web asset owner, get to standards compliance. What is often not that clear is the question of – what will WCAG compliance do for my users? How will my web asset benefit from this exercise? Does WCAG compliance mean that ALL users can use my web site ‘equitably’?</p> <p>Focusing on the WCAG standard as an example, the standards body has stated that the goal of defining “how to make Web content more accessible to people with disabilities”. The standards body has decided, I believe consciously, to not precisely define accessibility. Also note the comparative term “more accessible” is chosen instead of a more absolute or superlative term. There is an air of tentativeness, which again, I would think, is a conscious choice.</p> <p>There are a few more factors to consider: Standards, in its final form often represent less than the state of the art in technology due to the long life cycle of the standards process itself. This is also clear from the facts that often even as a particular standard is in the stages of approval, work on the next standards commences. Standards bodies often need to come up with a least common denominator in its specification and in the interest of expediency, generally have to choose to ignore complicated or controversial issues.</p> <p>Some of the issues related to accessibility, are so entwined in issues of usability and design, that it is difficult to make concrete standards without making assumptions about the nature of use of the system, the faculty set of the user and other environmental factors. In the continuum of accessibility-usability-design, the standards are only able to address the safe generalities than the highly variable specifics.</p> <p>The points above should not be read as criticisms of standards, but merely as an observation of the facts. Now, switching over to the practice side, take the classic cases where a web or digital asset owner takes the steps towards ensuring diversity. She is often driven by one or more of the following: - <em>Social and values based reasons – CSR for companies, social pressure for individuals</em><br /> - I care about diversity, and want to make sure that there are no barriers in my organization for people with a non-standard set of faculties<br /> - I have a digital asset and want to come across to others as someone who cares about diversity - <em>Regulatory and Legal</em><br /> - I need to comply to the accessibility rules/regulations/laws of my country/state/association in relation to and if I don’t there is a possible negative consequence<br /> - <em>Commercial</em><br /> - I or one of my customers have or will have an audience or customers that is diverse and needs accessibility - I or one of my customers need to show some others that we are accessible so that we can get some new business - I or one of my customers deal exclusively with a segment that have a non-standard set of faculties that have accessibility implications and our offering needs to be precisely tailored for them</p> <p>Consider the various cases above. While clearly not an exhaustive treatment of all possible cases, you can see 2 significant flavors: - I need to convince a certain constituency that my digital asset is accessible<br /> - I need to make my digital asset as accessible, usable and appropriate as possible to one or more specific class of users with non-standards faculties.</p> <p>In both these cases, standards compliance is a requirement. For case 2 above, however, the asset owner would be ill-advised to stop at standards compliance and should consider additional steps to put forth the best possible offering – from accessibility, usability and design standpoints for the specific audience(s) in mind.</p> <p>So here goes the stake in the ground: We believe that standards compliance is a necessary but not sufficient condition for ensuring best possible levels of accessibility. We do believe that current standards ensure a high degree of accessibility. However, we believe that there are additional steps that can and should be taken to allow a person with a non-standard set of faculties the best possible experience with a web site or application.</p> <hr> <footer> <p class="text-small text-grey-dk-100 mb-0">Copyright &copy; 2020-2025 Reuben Jacob.
