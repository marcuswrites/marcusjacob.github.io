    "content": "Hey there! . My name is Reuben Jacob. Thanks for being here. I recently started posting articles in public to reach more people to collaborate with. Started with publishing articles from an old blog as essays and then added some new ones. Then I added some of my views and influences for context. So if you’d like to get a reasonable view of me from a distance, you are in the right place. Alternatively, here is a brief intro: I am a human and an aspiring transhuman and interstellar traveler. After a few more decades here on earth to finish some projects, fix some problems that I think need fixing, while also showing up for some pre-committed roles for my family, I pack my bags. And then it’s Ad Astra!. Hopefully that’s enough time for SpaceX or one of its successors to arrange the transport. This is not entirely stated in jest. Quite a bit of my work so far has been related to technology. I have written many computer programs and architected software. I have also co-founded a tech incubator, an alternative school and been part of few other such interesting endeavours. I currently live in the San Francisco Bay Area. Would you be interested in collaborating on one of my current projects or help solve any of the problems that I care about? Would love to hear from you! . You can reach me via twitter or email . P.S. Some of the articles published here are works in progress, so please do check back for updated version. ",

I remember some of the authors were from the west like Bertrand Russel, and some from the east, such as Vivekananda. I had already decided that I would not be a practising Christian unlike my parents. On the one hand, many of the ideas were new and exciting. Others helped somewhat vague ideas that I had in mind to become a lot clearer and concrete. I was certain at that time that adults would know a lot more about how the world worked. I couldn’t wait to grow up and have the enhanced adult thinking faculties. Once, during a discussion with an uncle of mine, who .
